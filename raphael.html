          <h2>Special Abilities</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Ninjutsu: Like his brothers, he has a great sense of balance and
              agility. He can jump farther and higher than a human, as well as
              move quicker and more easily on narrow surfaces. He is the
              strongest fighter of the group (this is certainly true when
              training).
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              Enhanced Strength: He is the strongest turtle, lifting people over
              his head. He is also the most violent, and so he can deal harder
              blows - though this is not a question of strength, more of morals,
              his brothers would most likely not hit someone as hard as Raphael
              would. He was able to tackle Slash away from his brother Mikey.
              His greater strength may be do in part to his ferocious temper.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              Sai: He normally uses sai as sharpened fist-held stabbing knives.
              However, he does have a large collection of other weapons.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              Shell: He has the normal ability of a turtle to go into his shell.
            </li>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
          Raphael is the most violent of the four brothers. A straight-up
          brawler, he has very little patience for things like stealth, hiding
          in shadows, or keeping his voice down. While he's fiercely loyal to
          his brothers, he's also often the one giving them a hard time. Raphael
          is also the one most likely to strike out on his own when he feels
          slighted or underappreciated. His closest confidante was his pet
          turtle named Spike. Raphael's temper can get the better of him,
          causing him to get into situations over his head.
