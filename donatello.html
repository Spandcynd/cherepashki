          <h2>Special Abilities</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Ninjutsu: Like his brothers, he is a master ninja and is very
              agile, able to leap over rooftops and avoid attacks from enemies,
              including gunfire, weapons, and punches and kicks.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              Enhanced Strength: An regular turtle can pull 5x its body weight.
              He and his brothers have been mutated and have had years of
              training under a grand master of martial arts, so their strength
              has been amplified as a result.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              Intelligence and Communication: He is incredibly intelligent able
              to calculate complex equations in his head, create different
              machines and handle the creation of medicines and other chemical
              compounds. He enjoys tinkering with items he finds in the
              junkyards and in the abandoned part of the sewers, which have
              allowed him to make the Shellraiser, the T-phone and Tpod.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>Naginata: His bo-staff has a built switch blade on one end.</li>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
          Donatello is the team inventor and weaponeer. He creates all their
          gadgets from the simplest bo-staff to their incredible vehicles. He's
          utterly brilliant, able to cobble together fantastic stuff from things
          he's literally scrounged from a trash heap. He's obsessively
          detail-oriented and often impatient that his brothers can't keep up
          with him intellectually. But Donnie also happens to be the most
          reclusive and socially awkward of the Turtles - especially when April
          is on her way!
