          <h2>Special Abilities</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Ninjutsu: Like his brothers, he is a master ninja and is very agile, able to leap over
              rooftops and avoid attacks from enemies, including gunfire, weapons, and punches and
              kicks.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              Enhanced Strength: An regular turtle can pull 5x its body weight. He and his brothers
              have been mutated and have had years of training under a grand master of martial arts,
              so their strength has been amplified as a result.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              Intelligence and Communication: He is incredibly intelligent able to calculate complex
              equations in his head, create different machines and handle the creation of medicines
              and other chemical compounds. He enjoys tinkering with items he finds in the junkyards
              and in the abandoned part of the sewers, which have allowed him to make the
              Shellraiser, the T-phone and Tpod.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>Naginata: His bo-staff has a built switch blade on one end.</li>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
          Donatello is the team inventor and weaponeer. He creates all their gadgets from the
          simplest bo-staff to their incredible vehicles. He's utterly brilliant, able to cobble
          together fantastic stuff from things he's literally scrounged from a trash heap. He's
          obsessively detail-oriented and often impatient that his brothers can't keep up with him
          intellectually. But Donnie also happens to be the most reclusive and socially awkward of
          the Turtles - especially when April is on her way!
