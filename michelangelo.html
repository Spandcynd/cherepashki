          <ul>
            <li>
              Ninjutsu: Mikey is the most agile of all his brothers; his
              training as a ninja helped to balance and improve this, but his
              skills in skateboarding and dancing also gives Mikey an edge that
              will often shock his brothers. Mikey is an extremely good fighter.
            </li>
            <br />

              Pranks: He refers to himself as the king of pranks. Since he the
              most funniest of his brothers and he hasn't shown to be wrong
              since he was able to show his pranking skills against his brothers
              like water balloons as he wants to prank them all and he was able
              to use his prank of water ballon to use against the tank of the
              truck.

              correctly as he was shown great success as he may not be the great
              Ninja turtle for thinking of correctly of logic from his brothers

              own body weight, his strength is likewise altered. He isn't quite

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
          Physically the smallest of the Turtles and the least mature. Mikey is
          easily distracted and enthusiastic about... well, pretty much
          everything. He's also extremely creative. He has a thousand ideas, and
          every now and then, one of them will be brilliant. This combination of
          creativity and lack of focus gives him a kind of "flow" that the other
          Turtles cannot match. He's a social mutant and more than the others,
          pines to be part of the real world.
