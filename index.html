        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
          Leonardo is charismatic, easy going, hilarious, and clever. He can
          easily figure out any situation, and uses his quick-witted skills to
          beat opponents, clear obstacles, or land one of his many one-liners
          which he believes "fire up the team." As stated in "Mystic Mayhem",
          Leo uses these jokes as a way to cope with strange or stressful
          situations. He is extremely confident in himself, though this
          confidence can turn to arrogance in some situations. He is shown to be
          skeptical at times, like denying the existence of ghosts. However, he
          enjoys things like magic and mystic powers.
